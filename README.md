	(Links must be seperated by a line break)
* press the ***add all to queue*** button to, uh... add them to the queue  
	(If a comic does not get added, the link was invalid)
* Use ***remove selected*** and ***remove all*** to delete comics you dont want to download
<!-- end of the list -->

* Select a save folder by pressing the ***folder*** button  
* Check ***each catoon*** for the application to save all chapters of a cartoon under a common folder (***each chapter*** works likewise)  
###### There are multible ways chapters can be saved:  
* ***PDF file:***  every image of a given chapter is saved as a page in a PDF document. This results in one PDF file per chapter.
* ***CBZ file:***  chapters are saved as a Comic book archive file. Learn more [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comic_book_archive).
* ***multiple images:***  every image is saved seperately. The number of images per chapter can vary.
* ***one image:***  every image of a given chapter is stitched together verically to create one very tall image per chapter.
###### Warning: if a chapter is so long that the resulting merged image exceeds 30,000 pixels in height it will be down scaled (in some cases even until the text isn't readable anymore). In those cases the PDF option may be better.   
* Now you can click the ***start*** button and wait (all controls should be deactivated until the download is done)
